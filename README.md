## Features:
| OPCODE  | Name | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 0000  | LOAD(LDA)  | Loads the immediate value to the accumulater|
| 0001  |  ADD | Add the immediate value to the accumulator |
| 0010  | SUB  | Subtract the immediate value to the accumulator |
| 0011 | INC  | Add 1 to the value stored in the accumulator|
| 0100  |  DEC | Subtract 1 to the value stored in the accumulator |
| 0101  |  OUT | Output the value in the accumulator to the output port |
| 0110  |  IN | Load the value from the input port to the accumulator |
| 0111  |  JMP | Jump to the immediate address provided |

## How to use this program:
To open the project download the software Digital Logic sim. <br />
Make a project named as pt_123.
Go to the following location on your computer: <br />
C:\Users\{user name}\AppData\LocalLow\SebastianLague\Digital Logic Sim\V1\Projects\pt_123 <br />
Download the files form the repository in the above location.
Open the software again and click load project. <br />
Click pt_123
Now you will have all the chips (one of them will be 4-BIT-MP )
